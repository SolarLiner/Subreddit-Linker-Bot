# Subreddit Linker Bot
A reddit bot that links subreddits when shown in post titles.

## How does it work?
The bot searches for "/r/" in the title (ex: "xpost from /r/dogs") and posts a new comment with a link to the subreddit, for the lazy.

### Thanks to [/u/hygkolk](http://www.reddit.com/user/hygkolk) for running this.
I don't deserve any reward for this little amount of work. But you can help him buy all the beers ;)

  

## FAQ

### I don't want the subreddit to be linked !
If you are the author of the post, reply the message with "delete".

### I want none of my posts to be linked !
Then message **[/u/SolarLiner](http://www.reddit.com/user/SolarLiner/)** or **[/u/\_\_\_\_\_NotDeadpool\_\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/____NotDeadpool___/)** requesting to be blacklisted.

### I don't want my subreddit to be linked when posted on titles !
Then message /u/SolarLiner or /u/\_\_\_\_NotDeadpool\_\_\_ and request your subreddit to be blacklisted. They will check if you are a mod of the said subreddit before adding the entry.

### I don't want this bot to link subreddits on my subreddit !
Same as above, message us to request your subreddit to be blacklisted. We will check if you are a mod of the subreddit before adding the entry.

### But I don't want to be in completely blacklisted, just to not allow [action] !
Don't worry. All 3 blacklists are separate and requesting to be blacklisted in one won't blacklist you/your subreddit in the others.
